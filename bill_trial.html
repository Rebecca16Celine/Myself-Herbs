      <p>Founded in 2025, <strong>Nurtural Herbs</strong> is a passion project created by a group of four dedicated students who share a deep love for nature and a commitment to promoting the benefits of plants in our daily lives. What started as a simple idea has grown into a platform dedicated to sharing valuable, research-backed information about the incredible plants and herbs that surround us.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to empower individuals with knowledge about the natural world, helping them make informed decisions about their health, wellness, and lifestyle. We believe that nature holds the key to healing, nourishment, and balance, and we are here to help you unlock that potential.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Nurtural Herbs began as a small initiative during a college project. As students studying environmental science and botany, we were fascinated by the healing properties of plants and herbs. However, we noticed a gap in accessible, reliable information about how these natural resources could be integrated into everyday life. This realization inspired us to create a platform where people could learn about the benefits of plants in a simple, engaging, and practical way.</p>
      <p>Over time, Nurtural Herbs has evolved into a trusted resource for plant enthusiasts, health-conscious individuals, and anyone curious about the power of nature. Our journey has been fueled by a shared belief in the importance of sustainability, education, and community.</p>
